# useEffect practice tasks

### - To set up this project, run `npm install` in your terminal in the main folder of the project.

### - To start the app, run `npm run dev`, then open the link (http://localhost:5173/) in Chrome.

### - You can find 4 different components in the 'components' folder and your task is to debug/complete the useEffect() call to render the page as described in the description for each exercise. Start by reading the task in the component (for example in 'Task1_random_cat.jsx'), then enable the task by simply uncommenting it in the 'App.jsx' file. Only leave one task uncommented at a time!

### _Before starting to work on these tasks, it's recommended to take another look at the useEffect hook in our notes here (https://notes.northcoders.com/courses/js-front-end/useEffect)_
